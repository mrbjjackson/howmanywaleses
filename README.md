#How Many Waleses
------
I'm learning React at the moment.

I was looking for projects to test out my React skills while listening to Ellis James & John Robbins 5Live radio podcast.

There was a game about guessing how many times you could fit Wales into other things.

I decided it would be a quick and easy project so I made How Many Waleses.

Created by me, Ben Jackson. [ben@mrbjjackson.com](ben@mrbjjackson.com).

I'm a music producer and web developer from Cornwall.
